    "## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "- **Definition:** The broadest field; aims to create systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, without any human intervention.\n",
    "- **Goal:** Build applications that can operate autonomously, adapt, and solve problems.\n",
    "- **Types:**  \n",
    "  - *Narrow AI*: Specialized in one task (e.g., Siri, Alexa).\n",
    "  - *General AI(AGI)*: Human-level intelligence (not yet achieved).\n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - Self-driving cars  \n",
    "  - Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)\n",
    "  - Game-playing bots (e.g., AlphaGo)\n",
    "- **Key Interview Point:** AI is the umbrella term; ML and DL are subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "- **Definition:** A subset of AI that uses algorithms and models to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "- **Types:**  \n",
    "  - *Supervised Learning*: Labeled data (e.g., classification, regression)\n",
    "  - *Unsupervised Learning*: Unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)\n",
    "  - *Reinforcement Learning*: Learning via rewards and penalties\n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - Email spam detection  \n",
    "  - Credit scoring  \n",
    "  - Movie recommendations\n",
    "- **Key Interview Point:** ML requires data to learn; it improves performance as it sees more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "- **Definition:** A subset of ML that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to model complex patterns in data. Attempts to mimic the learning process of the human brain.\n",
    "- **Why Important:** Excels at tasks like image, speech, and text recognition.\n",
    "- **Key Concepts:**  \n",
    "  - *Neural Networks*: Modeled after the human brain  \n",
    "  - *Layers*: Input, hidden, output  \n",
    "  - *Backpropagation*: Backpropagation is a way for neural networks to learn from their mistakes.\n",
    "It works by measuring how wrong the prediction is, then adjusting the networkâ€™s weights backwards from the output to the input to improve future predictions.\n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - Face recognition  \n",
    "  - Language translation  \n",
    "  - Self-driving car perception\n",
    "- **Key Interview Point:** DL needs large datasets and high computational power (GPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Science (DS)\n",
    "- **Definition:** An interdisciplinary field focused on extracting insights from data using statistics, programming, and domain knowledge. It overlaps all of the above fields in different ways.\n",
    "- **Key Tasks:**  \n",
    "  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  \n",
    "  - Data visualization  \n",
    "  - Predictive modeling  \n",
    "  - Communicating results\n",
    "- **Tools:** Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc.\n",
    "- **Examples:**  \n",
    "  - Business analytics dashboards  \n",
    "  - Sales forecasting  \n",
    "  - Customer segmentation\n",
    "- **Key Interview Point:** Data Science is broader than AI/ML/DL; it includes the entire data pipeline, not just modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **AI â‰  ML â‰  DL â‰  DS:** Know the hierarchy and differences.\n",
    "- **ML vs. DL:** ML can use simple models (e.g., linear regression); DL uses neural networks.\n",
    "- **Data Science:** Not just modelingâ€”also data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and communication.\n",
    "- **Real-world:** Most business problems start with Data Science, then use ML/DL if needed.\n",
    "- **Common Question:** \"Is all ML AI? Is all AI ML?\"  \n",
    "  - All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML.  \n",
    "  - All DL is ML, but not all ML is DL.\n",
