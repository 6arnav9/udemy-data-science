    "## What are MSE, MAE, and RMSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- Measures the average of the squares of the errors (difference between actual and predicted values).\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Differentiable, convex, penalizes large errors more.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Not robust to outliers, **unit is squared** (e.g., if predicting salary in dollars, MSE is in dollarsÂ²).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- Measures the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Robust to outliers, same unit as target variable.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Not differentiable at zero, can be harder to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- Square root of MSE, brings error back to the original unit.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  RMSE = \\sqrt{MSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 }\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Same unit as target, penalizes large errors.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Not robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is \"Different Units\" a Disadvantage for MSE and RMSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSE** gives error in squared units (e.g., if predicting height in cm, MSE is in cmÂ²). This makes it hard to interpret directly or compare with the original data.\n",
    "- **RMSE** brings the error back to the original unit (e.g., cm), making it easier to interpret, but both are still affected by outliers.\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "  If your target is house price in dollars,  \n",
    "  - MSE = 1,000,000 means the average squared error is $1,000,000, but this is in dollarsÂ², which is not intuitive.\n",
    "  - RMSE = 1,000 means the average error is about $1,000, which is easier to understand.\n",
