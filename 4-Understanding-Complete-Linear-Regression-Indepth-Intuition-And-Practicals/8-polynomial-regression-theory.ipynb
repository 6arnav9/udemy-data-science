    "## Explanation of the Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Linear vs Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "- **Simple Linear Regression:**  \n",
    "  The model is $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$  \n",
    "  This fits a straight line to the data and works well only if the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear.\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression:**  \n",
    "  The model is $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3$  \n",
    "  This fits a hyperplane in higher dimensions for multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Non-Linear Relationships**\n",
    "- When the data shows a non-linear pattern, linear regression cannot capture the curve, leading to higher errors.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression** fits a curve by adding higher-degree terms (like $x^2$, $x^3$, etc.), reducing error for non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Polynomial Degrees**\n",
    "- **Degree = 0:**  \n",
    "  $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 x^0$  \n",
    "  This is just a constant value (horizontal line).\n",
    "- **Degree = 1:**  \n",
    "  $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 x^0 + \\beta_1 x^1$  \n",
    "  This is simple linear regression (straight line).\n",
    "- **Degree = 2:**  \n",
    "  $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 x^0 + \\beta_1 x^1 + \\beta_2 x^2$  \n",
    "  This fits a parabola (curve).\n",
    "- **Degree = n:**  \n",
    "  $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 x^0 + \\beta_1 x^1 + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x^n$  \n",
    "  This allows for more complex curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Visualizing Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "- As the degree increases, the model can fit more complex curves.\n",
    "- For example, with degree 1 (yellow line), the fit is linear. With higher degrees (red curve), the fit can capture more of the non-linear relationship in the data.\n",
    "- **Warning:** Very high degrees (like 15) can lead to overfitting, where the curve fits the training data too closely and may not generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Polynomial Regression with Multiple Features**\n",
    "- For two features ($x_1$, $x_2$):\n",
    "    - **Degree 1:** $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2$\n",
    "    - **Degree 2:** $h_\\theta(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1^2 + \\beta_4 x_2^2$\n",
    "- This allows the model to capture non-linear relationships involving multiple variables.\n",

    "## **Summary Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Degree | Model Equation | Shape of Fit         |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| 0      | $\\beta_0$     | Constant (flat line) |\n",
    "| 1      | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ | Straight line        |\n",
    "| 2      | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2$ | Parabola (curve)    |\n",
    "| n      | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\cdots + \\beta_n x^n$ | Complex curve        |\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Use polynomial regression when data shows a non-linear trend.\n",
    "- Higher degrees allow more flexibility but can overfit.\n",
    "- Polynomial regression can be extended to multiple features for more complex relationships."
