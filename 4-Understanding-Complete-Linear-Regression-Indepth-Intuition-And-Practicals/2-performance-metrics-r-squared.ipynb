    "## What is R Squared ($R^2$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R Squared** is a statistical measure that shows how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points.\n",
    "- It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n",
    "- **Range:** $0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1$ (or 0% to 100%)\n",
    "    - $R^2 = 1$: Perfect fit (model explains all variance)\n",
    "    - $R^2 = 0$: Model explains none of the variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{total}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $SS_{res} = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$ (Sum of squared residuals/errors)\n",
    "- $SS_{total} = \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ (Total sum of squares)\n",
    "- $y_i$: Actual value\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_i$: Predicted value\n",
    "- $\\bar{y}$: Mean of actual values\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "- $R^2 = 0.70$ means the model explains 70% of the variance in the data.\n",
    "- Higher $R^2$ means a better fit, but very high values can indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Adjusted R Squared ($R^2_{adj}$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusted R Squared** adjusts the $R^2$ value for the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "- It penalizes the addition of unnecessary independent variables.\n",
    "- Useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\left(1 - R^2\\right) \\frac{N-1}{N-p-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N$: Number of data points\n",
    "- $p$: Number of independent features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Adjusted R Squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding more variables to a model can artificially increase $R^2$, even if those variables are not meaningful.\n",
    "- Adjusted $R^2$ only increases if the new variable improves the model more than would be expected by chance.\n",

    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$R^2$** tells you how well your model fits the data.\n",
    "- **Adjusted $R^2$** tells you how well your model fits, accounting for the number of predictors.\n",
    "- Use **Adjusted $R^2$** when comparing models with different numbers of features.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
